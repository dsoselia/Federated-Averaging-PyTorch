# Beyond Linear Mixing in Federated Learning

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/vaseline555/Federated-Learning-PyTorch and expands the original FedAvg implemementation to include multiple strategies for non-linear mixing, such as various sampling strategies from posterior, polynomial approimation, and neural network approximation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 (This is a hard requirement due to dependencies)
- PyTorch 1.13
